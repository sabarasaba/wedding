        <p class="section-description expand">We are the lucky ones who met on online dating! The magic happened in Camden Town, London, on Sunday afternoon in 2014. We continued living  in North London for 2 years. We both work in IT, probably this is a secret how two people from different continents can live together:)</p>
        <p class="section-description expand">We knew that London is not the city where want to live forever so this summer we decided to give a shot for Amsterdam! So far we really enjoy this cute little city. We have already bought bikes and swam in a boat through the canals.</p>
